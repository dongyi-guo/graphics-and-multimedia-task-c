# Task C - 3D Animation Scene

* Random Texture

    * Every ball is having a different texture which is randomly picked from
the pool.

* Shot in different direction

  * The ball starts with different speed on all 3 dimensions which are
generated randomly as well, this will result in different shooting
direction. (Screenshots same as above)

* Bouncing Walls

  * If the ball hits either one of six walls, the ball will be bounced back,
including the camera wall.

* Bouncing with other balls

  * If the ball hits other balls, they all will be bounced away with each
other.

* Gravity

  * The ball will land on the floor eventually due to the gravity, vertical
speed of the ball will be influenced as time goes by.

* Energy Decay

  * Besides gravity, ball’s movement speed will be decreased since energy
of balls will be consumed and it won’t be able to move fast like last
second (frame) it used to, eventually ball will stop moving from all 3
dimensions.
